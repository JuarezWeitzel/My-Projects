# Cryptocurrency Project

This project was developed as part of the "React Js with TypeScript from Zero to Advanced in Practice" course and aims to practice routes and HTTP requests, establishing communications with external services and APIs, as well as handling data received from the API. Routing and responsiveness practices were also explored.

## Description

The project consists of a web application that provides information about cryptocurrencies. The displayed data includes the name of the currency, market value, price, and volume. The application also includes a search field to facilitate the location of specific currencies, as well as detailed pages for each currency with more comprehensive information.

*Note: Some improvements and adjustments were made by me to enhance the user experience and further apply the learned concepts. These enhancements included the use of Styled-Components, the implementation of a Dark/Light theme, and a translation system on the website, enabling translation between English and Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese). Additionally, I created a loading component and implemented a ContextAPI for it, providing a smoother experience during content loading. Moreover, a paging system between the currencies was also implemented. These improvements, which were not covered in the course, were implemented by me.*
