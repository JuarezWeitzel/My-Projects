# Cryptocurrency Project

This project was developed as part of the "React Js with TypeScript from Zero to Advanced in Practice" course and aims to practice routes and HTTP requests, establishing communications with external services and APIs, as well as handling data received from the API. Routing and responsiveness practices were also explored.

## Description

The project consists of a web application that provides information about cryptocurrencies. The displayed data includes the name of the currency, market value, price, and volume. The application also includes a search field to facilitate the location of specific currencies, as well as detailed pages for each currency with more comprehensive information.

*Note: Some improvements and adjustments were made by me to improve the user experience and further practice the concepts learned. These improvements included the use of Styled-Components, the implementation of Dark/Light theme and a translation system on the website from English to Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese) and vice versa, which are not present in the course.*
