# Cryptocurrency Project

This project was developed as part of the "React Js with TypeScript from Zero to Advanced in Practice" course and aims to practice routes and HTTP requests, establishing communications with external services and APIs, as well as handling data received from the API. Routing and responsiveness practices were also explored.

## Description

The project consists of a web application that provides information about cryptocurrencies. The displayed data includes the name of the currency, market value, price, and volume. The application also includes a search field to facilitate the location of specific currencies, as well as detailed pages for each currency with more comprehensive information.

### Improvements Implemented by Me

As part of enhancing user experience and delving deeper into learned concepts, I implemented several improvements and adjustments, including:

- Utilization of Styled-Components for more flexible and organized styling.
- Implementation of a Dark/Light theme system, providing users with the choice of their preferred visual preference.
- Integration of a translation system on the website, enabling seamless translation between English and Brazilian Portuguese.
- Development of a custom loading component, along with the implementation of a ContextAPI, to ensure a smoother content loading experience without interruptions.
- Introduction of a pagination system among currencies, enhancing usability and facilitating navigation through the content.

It's worth noting that these improvements, are not covered in the course, were devised and implemented by me to further optimize the functionality and overall experience of the project.
